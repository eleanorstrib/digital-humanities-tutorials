This code is fully explained in a [post](https://medium.com/agatha-codes/using-textual-analysis-to-quantify-a-cast-of-characters-4f3baecdb5c) on my technical blog, [Agatha](https://medium.com/agatha-codes).

This program is designed to be run in the command line/terminal.

You'll need the following installed to run it:
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine
- The Natural Language Processing Toolkit on your computer or in a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Any file in .txt format - the path will need to be added to the `characters.py` file where it now reads 'corpus/hp1.txt'

When you have that set up, run this file by typing `python characters.py` in the terminal/command line.

If you have any questions or feedback about the code, please comment on the accompanying [blog post](https://medium.com/agatha-codes/using-textual-analysis-to-quantify-a-cast-of-characters-4f3baecdb5c).
